This contains some notes on digital signal processing from Valerio Velardos' videos on digital audio processing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCwMQJnKk2c&list=PL-wATfeyAMNqIee7cH3q1bh4QJFAaeNv0). The numbered files are notes, and "scratchpad.ipynb" is just that - it may not contain anything coherent or useful.
